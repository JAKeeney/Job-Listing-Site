# PHP-SQL-site

Practice building a job listing site with PHP ft. JavaScript

Please note that the information in db.php should be edited to work for your database.
At leas two databases should be used: users and jobs.

"users" requires a "username" and a "password" column, and the password column should be md5 hashed.
"jobs" requires an "id", "title", "start", "end", and "description" column.

Examples (using PHPMyAdmin):

users: https://i.gyazo.com/e1437b94f59408cf385620474306f4df.png

jobs: https://i.gyazo.com/afd2506c0c08e4b5ea0daa364ba9b48f.png
